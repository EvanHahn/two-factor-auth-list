# Two-factor authentication list

I wanted a list of websites that supported two-factor authentication, so I made one.

See it live at [evanhahn.com/2fa](https://evanhahn.com/2fa/).

## Contributing something to the list

Option 1: send an email to <me@evanhahn.com> and I'll just add it.

Option 2: [edit data.json](https://github.com/EvanHahn/two-factor-auth-list/edit/master/data.json) and send a pull request.

Anything you contribute will be licensed under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) (basically the public domain).
