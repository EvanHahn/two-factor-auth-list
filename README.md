:fire: two-factor authentication list :fire:
============================================

*damn, look at that sweet fire emoji*

[two-factor authentication](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57586014-83/) is pretty neato. i wanted a list of websites that support it and so i made one.

contributing something to the list
----------------------------------

option 1: send an email to me@evanhahn.com and i'll just add it.

option 2: [edit data.json](https://github.com/EvanHahn/two-factor-auth-list/edit/master/data.json) and send a pull request.

anything you contribute will be licensed under the [unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) (basically the public domain). and also you will be credited on the page unless i'm an idiot and forget

deploying this
--------------

to deploy this, just put this folder wherever you want to serve it from. optionally, you can speed things up with a static page:

    $ php index.php > index.html

*"why php??"*, you cry. get over it, *nerd*

this puppy is deliberately

license
-------

this puppy is licensed under the unlicense (see LICENSE.txt) so you can do whatever you want with it. think of the endless possibilities

the websites herein are not covered under this license, but this does link to them.
